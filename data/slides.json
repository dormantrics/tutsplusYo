In the present age a rebellion is, of all things, the most unthinkable.  Such an expression of strength would seem ridiculous to the calculating intelligence of our times.  On the other hand a political virtuoso might bring off a feat almost as remarkable.  He might write a manifesto suggesting a general assembly at which people should decide upon a rebellion, and it would be so carefully worded that even the censor would let it pass.  At the meeting itself he would be able to create the impression that his audience had rebelled, after which they would all go quietly home--having spent a very pleasant evening."

For the development is, in spite of everything, a progress because all the individuals who are saved will receive the specific weight of religion, its essence at first hand, from God himself.

Astfel, a fi bolnav de moarte înseamnă a nu putea muri, totuşi nu ca şi când ar persista speranţa de a supravieţui, nu, ci absenţa speranţei constă în faptul că nu mai există nici măcar ultima speranţă, moartea. Atunci când pericolul suprem este moartea, ea speră în viaţă; cine a cunoscut însă pericolul şi mai îngrozitor, speră în moarte. Dacă, aşadar, pericolul este atât de mare încât se pun speranţele în moarte, disperarea constă în absenţa speranţei de a putea măcar muri. Disperarea este aşadar boala de moarte, această contradicţie chinuitoare, această boală aflată în sine, de a muri veşnic, de a muri fără totuşi să mori şi de a muri moartea. Căci a muri înseamnă că totul se încheie, dar a muri moartea arăta că trăieşti faptul de a muri; şi dacă îl trăieşti o singură clipă, înseamnă că îl trăieşti pe veci. Dacă omul ar muri de disperare aşa cum se moare de o boală, atunci ar trebui că eternul din el, sinele, să poată muri în acelaşi sens în care trupul moare dintr-o boală. Or acest lucru este imposibil; faptul de a muri al disperării se converteşte permanent în viaţă. Disperatul nu poate muri: «pe cât de puţin poate un pumnal să ucidă gânduri», pe atât de puţin poate mistui disperarea veşnicia, sinele aflat la baza disperării, al căror vierme nu piere şi al căror foc nu se stinge. Totuşi disperarea înseamnă tocmai să te macini în interior, dar este o măcinare neputincioasă a unui sine care nu este în stare de ceea ce vrea. Disperarea vrea însă să se nimicească, ceea ce îi este peste puteri, iar această slăbiciune este o nouă formă de a se roade pe dinăuntru, în care totuşi disperarea din nou nu poate ce vrea, să se autodistrugă, ci avem de-a face cu o potenţare sau cu legea ridicării la putere. Această măcinare este ceea ce aţâţă sau e incendiul glacial din disperare, o măcinare întoarsă mereu spre interior şi care roade tot mai ad��nc şi tot mai neputincios din sine. Pentru cel ce disperă nu este o consolare nici măcar faptul că disperarea pe el nu-l distruge; dimpotrivă, tocmai această consolare este supliciul care ţine în viaţă disperarea mistuitoare şi viaţa în durere mistuitoare. Căci tocmai de aceea el nu a disperat, ci disperă: pentru că nu se poate distruge, nu se poate lepăda de sine, nu se poate nimici. Aceasta este formula potenţată a disperării, urcarea febrei în această boală a sinelui."

Let us collect all the New Testaments we have, let us bring them out to an open square or up to the summit of a mountain, and while we all kneel let one man speak to God thus: 'Take this book back again; we men, such as we now are, are not fit to go in for this sort of thing, it only makes us unhappy,' This is my proposal, that like those inhabitants in Gerasa we beseech Christ to depart from our borders. This would be an honest and human way of talking -- rather different from the disgusting hypocritical priestly fudge..."

No, the fact that God does this is the seriousness of existence.  And the seriousness in this seriousness is, in turn, that each  <em>shall</em> have an opinion about it."
