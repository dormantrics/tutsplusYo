Hitherto I have had no success; and though I have young legs, I am almost weary from running back and forth... <br /><br />Once or twice I have been on the verge of bending the knee. But at the last moment, when I already had my handkerchief spread on the ground, to avoid soiling my trousers, and I made a trusting appeal to one of the initiated who stood by: \"Tell me now sincerely, is it entirely finished; for if so I will kneel down before it, even at the risk of ruining a pair of trousers (for on account of the heavy traffic to and from the system, the road has become quite muddy),\" - I always receive the same answer: \"No, it is not yet quite finished.\" And so there was another postponement - of the system, and of my homage. <br /><br />System and finality are pretty much one and the same, so much so that if the system is not finished, there is no system."

This would be an honest and human way of talking -- rather different from the disgusting hypocritical priestly fudge..."

No, the fact that God does this is the seriousness of existence.  And the seriousness in this seriousness is, in turn, that each  <em>shall</em> have an opinion about it."
