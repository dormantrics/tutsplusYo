If an individual is too fragile to stand clarity and transparency, well, then one enjoys what is unclear, but apparently she can stand it. The more devotedness one can bring to erotic love, the more interesting. This momentary enjoyment is a rape, even if not outwardly but nevertheless mentally, and in a rape there is only imagined enjoyment; it is like a stolen kiss, something nondescript. No, if one can bring it to a point where a girl has but one task for her freedom, to give herself, so that she feels her whole happiness in this, so that she practically begs for this devotedness and yet is free-only then is there enjoyment, but this always takes a discerning touch"

Căci tocmai aceasta vrea cu disperare şi, spre durerea sa, nu poate, fiindcă prin disperare a fost dat pradă flacărilor ceva ce nu poate arde sau nu poate să fie mistuit, sinele. O fetişcană disperă din dragoste, deci disperă pentru pierderea iubitului, care a murit sau i-a devenit infidel. Aceasta nu este o disperare care s-a manifestat, ci ea disperă pentru ea însăşi. Acest sine al ei, de care s-ar fi eliberat sau pe care l-ar fi pierdut la modul cel mai încântător cu putinţă dacă ar fi devenit iubita «lui». Acest sine este acum pentru ea o calamitate, pentru că trebuie să fie un sine fără «el»; acest sine care ar fi devenit comoara ei, deşi ar fi fost de altfel la fel de disperat, chiar dacă într-un alt sens, a devenit acum pentru ea respingător de gol, din moment ce «el» este mort sau i-a devenit odios, amintinu-şi că a înşelat-o. Încearcă acum să-i spui unei asemenea fete: «Te distrugi pe tine însăţi!» şi o vei auzi răspunzând: «O, nu, durerea mea este tocmai că nu o pot face.»"

No longer can the individual, as in former times, turn to the great for help when he grows confused.  That is past; he is either lost in the dizziness of unending abstraction or saved for ever in the reality of religion.  Perhaps very many will cry out in despair, but it will not help them--already it is too late...Nor shall any of the unrecognizable presume to help directly or to speak directly or to teach directly at the head of the masses, in order to direct their decisions, instead of giving his negative support and so helping the individual to make the decision which he himself has reached; any other course would be the end of him, because he would be indulging in the short-sighted compassion of man, instead of obeying the order of divinity, of an angry, yet so merciful, divinity.  For the development is, in spite of everything, a progress because all the individuals who are saved will receive the specific weight of religion, its essence at first hand, from God himself.  Then it will be said: 'behold, all is in readiness, see how the cruelty of abstraction makes the true form of worldliness only too evident, the abyss of eternity opens before you, the sharp scythe of the leveller makes it possible for every one individually to leap over the blade--and behold, it is God who waits.  Leap, then, into the arms of God'.  But the 'unrecognizable' neither can nor dares help man, not even his most faithful disciple, his mother, or the girl for whom he would gladly give his life: they must make the leap themselves, for God's love is not a second-hand gift.  And yet the 'unrecognizable' neither can nor dares help man, not even his most faithful disciple, his mother, or the girl for whom he would gladly give his life: they must make the leap themselves, for God's love is not a second-hand gift.  And yet the 'unrecognizable' (according to his degree) will have a double work compared with the 'outstanding' man (of the same degree), because he will not only have to work continuously, but at the same time labour to conceal his work."

Astfel, a fi bolnav de moarte înseamnă a nu putea muri, totuşi nu ca şi când ar persista speranţa de a supravieţui, nu, ci absenţa speranţei constă în faptul că nu mai există nici măcar ultima speranţă, moartea. Atunci când pericolul suprem este moartea, ea speră în viaţă; cine a cunoscut însă pericolul şi mai îngrozitor, speră în moarte. Dacă, aşadar, pericolul este atât de mare încât se pun speranţele în moarte, disperarea constă în absenţa speranţei de a putea măcar muri. Disperarea este aşadar boala de moarte, această contradicţie chinuitoare, această boală aflată în sine, de a muri veşnic, de a muri fără totuşi să mori şi de a muri moartea. Căci a muri înseamnă că totul se încheie, dar a muri moartea arăta că trăieşti faptul de a muri; şi dacă îl trăieşti o singură clipă, înseamnă că îl trăieşti pe veci. Dacă omul ar muri de disperare aşa cum se moare de o boală, atunci ar trebui că eternul din el, sinele, să poată muri în acelaşi sens în care trupul moare dintr-o boală. Or acest lucru este imposibil; faptul de a muri al disperării se converteşte permanent în viaţă. Disperatul nu poate muri: «pe cât de puţin poate un pumnal să ucidă gânduri», pe atât de puţin poate mistui disperarea veşnicia, sinele aflat la baza disperării, al căror vierme nu piere şi al căror foc nu se stinge. Totuşi disperarea înseamnă tocmai să te macini în interior, dar este o măcinare neputincioasă a unui sine care nu este în stare de ceea ce vrea. Disperarea vrea însă să se nimicească, ceea ce îi este peste puteri, iar această slăbiciune este o nouă formă de a se roade pe dinăuntru, în care totuşi disperarea din nou nu poate ce vrea, să se autodistrugă, ci avem de-a face cu o potenţare sau cu legea ridicării la putere. Această măcinare este ceea ce aţâţă sau e incendiul glacial din disperare, o măcinare întoarsă mereu spre interior şi care roade tot mai ad��nc şi tot mai neputincios din sine. Pentru cel ce disperă nu este o consolare nici măcar faptul că disperarea pe el nu-l distruge; dimpotrivă, tocmai această consolare este supliciul care ţine în viaţă disperarea mistuitoare şi viaţa în durere mistuitoare. Căci tocmai de aceea el nu a disperat, ci disperă: pentru că nu se poate distruge, nu se poate lepăda de sine, nu se poate nimici. Aceasta este formula potenţată a disperării, urcarea febrei în această boală a sinelui."
